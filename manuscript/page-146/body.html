<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two or three friends&mdash;you among them&mdash;and as for the rest I only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of them are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women&mdash;countesses or cooks&mdash;who were not venal. I have not yet met that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a one I&rsquo;d give my life for her! But those!...&rdquo; and he made a gesture of contempt. &ldquo;And believe me, if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
