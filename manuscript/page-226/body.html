<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the Torzh√≥k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and tea?&rdquo; asked his valet.</p><p>Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same question&mdash;one so important that he took no notice of what went on around him.</p></div> </div>
