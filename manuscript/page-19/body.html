Two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.</p><p>&ldquo;Hallo, Gwíska&mdash;my pipe!&rdquo; came Vasíli Denísov&rsquo;s husky voice. &ldquo;Wostóv, get up!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
