<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, Count,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;he is too noble and pure-souled for our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it honorable, of Bezúkhov? And Fédya, with his noble spirit, loved him and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg when they played some tricks on a policeman, didn&rsquo;t they do it together? And there! Bezúkhov got off scotfree, while Fédya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through! It&rsquo;s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he. And now&mdash;this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It&rsquo;s well God had mercy on us.</p></div> </div>
