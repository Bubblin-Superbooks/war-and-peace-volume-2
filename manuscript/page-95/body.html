<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow.</p><p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;I have killed her lover, yes, killed my wife&rsquo;s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Because you married her,&rdquo; answered an inner voice.</p><p>&ldquo;But in what was I to blame?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;In marrying her without loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.&rdquo; And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vas√≠li&rsquo;s, when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter: &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; &ldquo;It all comes from that! Even then I felt it,&rdquo; he thought.</p></div> </div>
