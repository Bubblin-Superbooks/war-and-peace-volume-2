If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostromá used to tell me. &lsquo;Everyone fears a bear,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;but when you see one your fear&rsquo;s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s how it is with me. À demain, mon cher.&rdquo; *</p></div> </div>
