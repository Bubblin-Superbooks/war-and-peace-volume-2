Today, when he had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry her, Rostóv thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him! &ldquo;Yes, they have taken a wise decision,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I must remain free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, that&rsquo;s excellent,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
