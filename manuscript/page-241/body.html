Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a regrettable delusion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,&rdquo; said Pierre, with a faint smile.</p><p>&ldquo;I should never dare to say that I know the truth,&rdquo; said the Mason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness. &ldquo;No one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,&rdquo; he added, and closed his eyes.</p></div> </div>
