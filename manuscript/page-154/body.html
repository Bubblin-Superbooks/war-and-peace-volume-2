It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Denísov were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people were present, including Dólokhov and Denísov.</p><p>Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostóvs&rsquo; house as at this holiday time. &ldquo;Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here,&rdquo; said the spirit of the place.</p></div> </div>
