<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words of the Gospel: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,&rdquo; Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel&mdash;it seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around.</p></div> </div>
