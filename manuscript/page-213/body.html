And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town:</p><p>&ldquo;Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I need some money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said his father, who was in a specially good humor. &ldquo;I told you it would not be enough. How much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, &ldquo;I have lost a little, I mean a good deal, a great deal&mdash;forty three thousand.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
