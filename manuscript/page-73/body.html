<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rost贸v was talking merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rost贸v looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a word&mdash;an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rost贸v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor&rsquo;s health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you about?&rdquo; shouted Rost贸v, looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear it&rsquo;s His Majesty the Emperor&rsquo;s health?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
