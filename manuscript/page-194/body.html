I had a splendid card all ready,&rdquo; as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up! I&rsquo;m lost!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Now a bullet through my brain&mdash;that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left me!&rdquo; And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Come now, just this one more little card!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Dólokhov, having finished the addition. &ldquo;All right! Twenty-one rubles,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rostóv submissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.</p></div> </div>
