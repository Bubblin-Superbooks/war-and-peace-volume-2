<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The men who set the tone in conversation&mdash;Count Rostopchín, Prince Yúri Dolgorúkov, Valúev, Count Markóv, and Prince Vyázemski&mdash;did not show themselves at the club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others&mdash;Ilyá Rostóv among them&mdash;remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the club&rsquo;s opinion reappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be said.</p></div> </div>
