The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son&rsquo;s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.</p><p>Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.
