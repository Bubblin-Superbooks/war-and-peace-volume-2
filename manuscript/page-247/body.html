He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in the Mason&rsquo;s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.&rdquo;</p><p>The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.</p><p>&ldquo;The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to imbibe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
