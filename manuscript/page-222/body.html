She began to sob aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Countess, I have done w&rsquo;ong,&rdquo; Denísov went on in an unsteady voice, &ldquo;but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over...&rdquo; He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe face said: &ldquo;Well, good-by, Countess,&rdquo; and kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without looking at Natásha.</p><p>Next day Rostóv saw Denísov off. He did not wish to stay another day in Moscow. All Denísov&rsquo;s Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at the gypsies&rsquo;, with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.</p></div> </div>
