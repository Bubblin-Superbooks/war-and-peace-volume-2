How she is singing today!&rdquo; And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats: &ldquo;Oh mio crudele affetto.&rdquo;... One, two, three... one, two, three... One... &ldquo;Oh mio crudele affetto.&rdquo;... One, two, three... One. &ldquo;Oh, this senseless life of ours!&rdquo; thought Nicholas. &ldquo;All this misery, and money, and Dólokhov, and anger, and honor&mdash;it&rsquo;s all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natásha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She&rsquo;s taken it! Thank God!&rdquo; And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third below the high note. &ldquo;Ah, God! How fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!&rdquo; he thought.</p></div> </div>
