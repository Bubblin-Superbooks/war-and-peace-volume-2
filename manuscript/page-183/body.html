I lose to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?&rdquo; he asked again.</p><p>Rostóv submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written &ldquo;800 rubles&rdquo; in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled at Dólokhov&rsquo;s words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dólokhov&rsquo;s hands which held the pack. Much depended on Rostóv&rsquo;s winning or losing on that seven of hearts.</p></div> </div>
