Most likely the doctor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my God! thank God!&rdquo; said Princess Mary. &ldquo;I must go and meet him, he does not know Russian.&rdquo;</p><p>Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.</p></div> </div>
