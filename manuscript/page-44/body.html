He&rsquo;s not there himself, so you&rsquo;ll have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the Rasgulyáy&mdash;the coachman Ipátka knows&mdash;and look up the gypsy Ilyúshka, the one who danced at Count Orlóv&rsquo;s, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
