You are under a delusion,&rdquo; said Prince Vasíli, as he entered. &ldquo;I know all about it, and I can tell you positively that Hélène is as innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasíli interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know all about it and understand it all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You behaved as becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won&rsquo;t go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,&rdquo; he added, lowering his voice. &ldquo;She is living in Moscow and you are here.</p></div> </div>
