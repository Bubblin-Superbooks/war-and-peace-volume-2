As if that money could add a hair&rsquo;s breadth to happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?&mdash;death which ends all and must come today or tomorrow&mdash;at any rate, in an instant as compared with eternity.&rdquo; And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, and again it turned uselessly in the same place.</p></div> </div>
