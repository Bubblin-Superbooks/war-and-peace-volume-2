Hm...!&rdquo; growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not moving a muscle.</p><p>&ldquo;And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me... I beg you,&rdquo; muttered Pierre hoarsely.</p><p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,&rdquo; said she.</p></div> </div>
