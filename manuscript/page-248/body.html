<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that is so,&rdquo; said Pierre joyfully.</p><p>&ldquo;The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest wisdom has but one science&mdash;the science of the whole&mdash;the science explaining the whole creation and man&rsquo;s place in it. To receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one&rsquo;s inner self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one&rsquo;s self. And to attain this end, we have the light called conscience that God has implanted in our souls.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
