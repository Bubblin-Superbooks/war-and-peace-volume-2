She was already pale, but on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy&mdash;a supreme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of this world&mdash;overflowed the great grief within her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do not turn away from me, let us weep together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Scoundrels! Blackguards!&rdquo; shrieked the old man, turning his face away from her. &ldquo;Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and tell Lise.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
