When that had been done, the Rhetor said:</p><p>&ldquo;In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.&rdquo;</p><p>Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the Rhetor&rsquo;s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre&rsquo;s left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot.</p></div> </div>
