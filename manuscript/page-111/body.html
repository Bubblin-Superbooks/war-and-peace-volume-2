<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutúzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.</p><p>&ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; wrote Kutúzov, &ldquo;fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment&mdash;he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
