<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,&rdquo; read the Grand Master, &ldquo;but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother&rsquo;s aid whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost.&rdquo;</p><p>He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides.</p></div> </div>
