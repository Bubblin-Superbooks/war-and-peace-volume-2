<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdánovna be sent for?&rdquo; said one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdánovna was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; assented Princess Mary, &ldquo;perhaps that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ll go. Courage, my angel.&rdquo; She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess&rsquo; face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s only indigestion?... Say it&rsquo;s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...&rdquo; And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogdánovna.</p></div> </div>
