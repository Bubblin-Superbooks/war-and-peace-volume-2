<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostóv returned home on leave. Denísov was going home to Vorónezh and Rostóv persuaded him to travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Denísov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostóv, who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.</p><p>&ldquo;How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets, shops, bakers&rsquo; signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!&rdquo; thought Rostóv, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered Moscow.</p></div> </div>
