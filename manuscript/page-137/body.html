A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding it shut.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in! You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said a terrified voice from within.</p><p>He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek&mdash;it could not be hers, she could not scream like that&mdash;came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.</p></div> </div>
